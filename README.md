# Object detection with webcam

Try it here : https://devlab-mj5.vercel.app/
You just have to autorise the webcam !

## How it works

We use the ml5 lib and its Object Detection Model with P5 canvas and drawing.
We first made it work by uploading images in local but we needed more challenge so we made with the webcam !

## Download

Once you've downloaded it, you just have to open it on a live server (or in local in your browser) and that's it !
Enjoy ;)
